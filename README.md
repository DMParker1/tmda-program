# Targeted Mass Drug Administration (tMDA) — Southeast Asia

**What this is:**  
This repository documents the targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) component of malaria elimination research in Southeast Asia. While mass drug administration has been widely used for neglected tropical diseases, its use for malaria has been controversial due to past misuse and concerns about drug resistance. This repo curates papers, figures, and notes from tMDA trials and modeling studies I contributed to across Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos.

**My role:**  
I worked as part of the Mahidol–Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) team, led by Lorenz von Seidlein and Arjen Dondorp, contributing to field research, data analysis, and modeling. I was based at a field station during this time (the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit), but contributed mapping/GIS and analytics expertise to most of the field sites (except for Vietnam). I documented herd effects, analyzed space-time patterns, and developed models exploring the theoretical limits of tMDA in connected communities. I also linked tMDA work to the infrastructure and surveillance systems built under the [METF-mapping](https://github.com/DMParker1/METF-mapping) program in Karen/Kayin State, Myanmar.

## Why this matters
- **Challenge:** Traditional mass drug administration for malaria was often avoided after historical use. For example, adding antimalarials to table salt may have contributed to the emergence and/or spread of drug resistant parasites. Article briefly discussing this, and including an audio interview [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1403340)
- **Hypothesis:** In low-to-moderate transmission settings with ready access to early diagnosis and treatment (EDT), tMDA could rapidly reduce parasite reservoirs, including among asymptomatic carriers who would otherwise remain untreated.
- **Key insight:** Asymptomatic *P. falciparum* infections can be common even in so-called low transmission areas — especially in certain high-risk communities — making targeted interventions valuable.
- **Results:** tMDA can be safe and effective when done with strong community engagement, good diagnostics, and a supportive treatment network, but effects may be temporary if surrounded by high-transmission areas.

### Commentary & debate
- **Response to Cochrane review limitations on MDA & vivax:**
  There was a Cochrane review paper that, using mostly our papers, [suggested that MDA for vivax malaria would not work]. (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008846.pub3/full)
Since we did tMDA for falciparum malaria, it doesn't make sense to use our results as evidence against tMDA working for vivax malaria. tMDA for vivax would require using some kind of anti-hypnozoite. Our response [here:](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008846.pub3/detailed-comment/en?messageId=326098774)
