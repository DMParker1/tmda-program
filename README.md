# Targeted Mass Drug Administration (tMDA) — Southeast Asia

**What this is:**  
This repository documents the targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) component of malaria elimination research in Southeast Asia. While mass drug administration has been widely used for neglected tropical diseases, its use for malaria has been controversial due to past misuse and concerns about drug resistance. This repo curates papers, figures, and notes from tMDA trials and modeling studies I contributed to across Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos.

**My role:**  
I worked as part of the Mahidol–Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) team, led by Lorenz von Seidlein and Arjen Dondorp, contributing to field research, data analysis, and modeling. I documented herd effects, analyzed space-time patterns, and developed models exploring the theoretical limits of tMDA in connected communities. I also linked tMDA work to the infrastructure and surveillance systems built under the [METF-mapping](https://github.com/DMParker1/METF-mapping) program in Karen/Kayin State, Myanmar.

## Why this matters
- **Challenge:** Traditional mass drug administration for malaria was often avoided after historical use (e.g., adding antimalarials to table salt) likely contributed to the spread of drug resistance.
- **Hypothesis:** In low-to-moderate transmission settings with ready access to early diagnosis and treatment (EDT), tMDA could rapidly reduce parasite reservoirs, including among asymptomatic carriers who would otherwise remain untreated.
- **Key insight:** Asymptomatic *P. falciparum* infections can be common even in so-called low transmission areas — especially in certain high-risk communities — making targeted interventions valuable.
- **Results:** tMDA can be safe and effective when done with strong community engagement, good diagnostics, and a supportive treatment network, but effects may be temporary if surrounded by high-transmission areas.

## Connections
- **Precursor:** [early-dx-tx-borderlands](https://github.com/DMParker1/early-dx-tx-borderlands) — EDT systems in Karen State, Myanmar.
- **Sibling repo:** [METF-mapping](https://github.com/DMParker1/METF-mapping) — mapping and CE groundwork for METF.
- **Downstream:** Modeling work on connectivity and intervention limits.
